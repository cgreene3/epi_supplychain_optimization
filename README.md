## Inventory and Order Management for Healthcare Commodities during a Pandemic

The code in this repository uses Python to run an optimization model that generates optimal ordering plans including quantities and timing of orders for a set of suppliers and SKUs over a user-specified forecasting period (e.g., twelve weeks) and time intervals (e.g., one week.) The supply received is added to the available inventory that can be used to fulfill demand for a set of healthcare commodities and populations in each time interval. The optimization model allows demand requests to be carried over when not fulfilled during the requested time interval but penalizes delays. The model allows substitution of healthcare commodities (e.g., medical-grade N95 masks with medical-grade surgical masks) when the most suitable items are not available. The user specifies the set of supplier-SKUs that can satisfy the demand for each healthcare and population type to indicate possible substitutions, and the suitability score that acts as a penalty when the substitution reduces protection or treatment effectiveness. The user also specifies a criticality score that represents the prioritization for each healthcare commodity and population type based on the relative consequences of delays and substitution. We introduce a Healthcare Commodity Metric employed in the objective function of the optimization model that combines criticality and suitability scores to quantify the relative impact of delays and substitutions for each healthcare commodity and population type considered in the model set. The Healthcare Commodity Metric is designed to ensure that highly critical populations and healthcare commodities are prioritized in terms of minimizing delays and substitutions when supply, inventory, budgets, or warehouse space is limited.
